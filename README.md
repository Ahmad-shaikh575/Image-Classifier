# Image-Classifier

A model that classifies images of 102 different categories of flowers.<br>

This project is part of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. The goal is to create an image classifier to identify flowers. The project consists of 2 parts:<br>

1.Implementation of training and prediction in Jupyter notebook<br>
2.Porting the code from Jupyter notebook to 2 separate scripts: to train a network model and to classify an image based on an existing trained network model.<br>
